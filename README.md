__SphereAndVector.html__ uses _three.js_ to suggest how a vector field of tangents to a surface could be constructed. &nbsp;In this very minimal and basic example, a single line representing a vector is translated (like a particle in a fluid flow) but always retains its property of being tangential to the surface of a sphere. &nbsp;(Use the mouse to drag and zoom. &nbsp;_OrbitControls.js_ is available from repository _threejs-inherited-transformations_.)

__SphereAndVectorBuffer.html__ is like _SphereAndVector.html_, but an instance of _THREE.BufferGeometry()_ is used for the 'vector' representation, rather than an instance of of _THREE.Geometry()_.
