__SphereAndVector.html__ uses _three.js_ to demonstrate how a vector field of tangents to a surface can be constructed. &nbsp;In this very minimal and basic example, a single line representing a vector is translated (like a particle in a fluid flow) but always retains its property of being tangential to the surface of a sphere. &nbsp;(Use the mouse to drag and zoom. &nbsp;_OrbitControls.js_ is available from repository _threejs-inherited-transformations_.)
